# 100DaysofMLCode
Although I'm a bit late, I will start the 100days of ML code challenge, where I will dedicate an hour everyday to learning ML
Day 1: https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/

Day 2: Continued stuff from Day 1 and fully understood the code, also took notes from some articles on the website, such as Randomness
