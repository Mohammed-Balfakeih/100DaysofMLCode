Day 1: https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/

Day 2: Continued stuff from Day 1 and fully understood the code, also took notes from some articles on the website, such as Randomness

Day 3: Started working on the book Hands on Machine learning with Sci-kitlearn and Tensorflow: Took some notes and went through the first example, starting to work on the 2nd chapter

Day 4: Continued working through the book, updated Chapter2.ipynb check insta and twitter @mbalfakeih to see what I learnt
